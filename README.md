# syslog-listener-generator

If you are able to ping the syslog server but the listener is not receiving any syslog messages, there could be several reasons why this is happening. Here are a few things to check:

Firewall: Make sure that the firewall on the syslog server or the network is not blocking incoming traffic on the syslog port (usually UDP port 514). You may need to configure the firewall to allow incoming traffic on this port.

Routing: Ensure that the syslog messages are being sent to the correct IP address of the syslog server. Check the routing tables on the devices to ensure that the syslog messages are being routed correctly to the server.

Syslog Configuration: Check the syslog configuration on the sender device to ensure that the syslog messages are being sent to the correct IP address and port of the syslog server. Ensure that the syslog messages are being sent using the correct format and that the server is configured to receive syslog messages in that format.

Listener Configuration: Double-check the listener configuration to ensure that it is listening on the correct IP address and port. Ensure that any firewalls or network devices between the sender and the listener are configured to allow traffic on the syslog port.
